# Sample-Project1

Making this project taught me a lot of practical things as a beginner coder.

All the theories made sense as I was writing the code.

I got frustrated several times only to find out that there was only a missing slash, or comma, or apostrophe...

I learn that you have to be really precise and have an eye for detail.

A single typo can cost you a day's worth of work.

Despite all this, making my first ever website was very satisfying seeing it come to life.

It may not be the best one yet, but it was my very first output as a beginner.

This is so worth it.
